# Santa's Gift Battle - Game Design Document

## Game Overview
A 2D side-scrolling arcade game where players control Santa Claus on a magical sleigh, delivering color-matched gifts to chimneys while competing with other AI-controlled Santas. The game combines gift delivery mechanics with combat elements inspired by Dragon Ball's energy mechanics.

## Core Game Mechanics

### Santa Movement
- Continuous flying movement on magical sleighs
- Full directional control (up, down, left, right)
- Acceleration-based movement
- Ability to consume energy for speed boost
- Collision detection between sleighs

### Gift System
- Three gift colors: Red, Green, Blue
- Gift spawning in clouds
- Maximum carrying capacity: 3 gifts
- Gifts can be thrown from any altitude
- In-flight gifts can be stolen by other Santas

### Chimney Mechanics
- Stationary chimneys on top of houses
- Color-coded to match gifts
- Wrong color delivery results in gift waste
- Successful delivery generates energy clouds

### Energy System
- Starting energy: 0
- Energy clouds emerge from chimneys after successful delivery
- Energy clouds float towards the delivering Santa
- Energy can be stolen by other Santas
- No maximum energy cap
- Energy uses:
  * Charging fireballs
  * Speed boost

### Combat System
- Fireball mechanics:
  * Charge time affects size and power
  * Larger fireballs move slower
  * Energy consumption: 1 chimney energy per second of charging
  * Fireballs vanish after traveling a certain distance
- Defensive mechanics:
  * Ability to dodge fireballs
  * Counter larger fireballs with own charged fireball
- Impact effects:
  * Small fireball: Knock-back effect
  * Large fireball: Elimination

## Game Progression

### Game Mode
- Endless arcade-style gameplay
- Three difficulty levels:
  * Easy
  * Normal
  * Hard

### AI Opponents
- 3 computer-controlled Santas
- Increasing AI intelligence with difficulty levels
- Competitive behaviors:
  * Gift collection
  * Gift delivery
  * Energy collection
  * Combat engagement

## Technical Specifications

### Display and Graphics
- Full browser window utilization
- Automatic zoom adjustment based on action
- Side-scrolling 2D perspective
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Controls
- Primary input methods:
  * Keyboard controls
  * Touch screen support
- Future-proofed for potential gamepad support

### Performance Requirements
- Smooth animation and movement
- Efficient collision detection
- Optimized rendering for browser environment

## Future Considerations

### Multiplayer Support
- Design architecture to support future multiplayer implementation
- Consider networking requirements
- Plan for session management

### Expandability
- Color system expandability
- New power-ups and mechanics
- Additional game modes

## Outstanding Questions

### Gameplay Balance
1. What is the optimal energy-to-speed boost ratio?
2. How should fireball damage scale with size?
3. What is the ideal gift spawning rate?

### Technical Implementation
1. Specific collision detection method for different entity types
2. Optimal approach for AI difficulty scaling
3. Best practices for touch control implementation

### Visual Design
1. Visual indicators for energy levels
2. Feedback system for successful/failed deliveries
3. Effects for fireball charging and impacts

## Next Steps
1. Create basic movement prototype
2. Implement gift collection and delivery system
3. Add energy mechanics
4. Develop combat system
5. Design AI behaviors
6. Balance gameplay elements
7. Polish user interface and visual feedback
