Design documents for the Nukes game

# Summary

The task is to generate design documents for the current game play and put it them to `./docs/design/game` directory.

Those documents later will be used together with the codegen tool to make changes the game.
A change in the game mechanic will be reflected both in the generated documents and in game code.
Sometimes game code will be updated first, and then the documents will updated accordingly either manually or with codegen.
