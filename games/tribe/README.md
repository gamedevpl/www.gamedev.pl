## Assets

This game uses assets from the **Sprout Lands Asset Pack** by **Cup Nooble**.
- Asset Pack: [Sprout Lands Asset Pack](https://cupnooble.itch.io/sprout-lands-asset-pack)
- Creator: Cup Nooble
- Used under license for berry bush sprites

The Sprout Lands assets enhance the visual experience of the game by replacing procedural graphics with hand-crafted pixel art. Currently integrated:

### Visual Assets
- **Berry Bush Sprites**: Hand-drawn berry bush sprites replace the original procedural circular berry bushes, featuring detailed foliage and realistic berry placement.

### Technical Implementation
The game includes a new image asset loading system (`src/game/assets/`) that:
- Loads image assets asynchronously during game initialization
- Provides fallback to procedural rendering if assets fail to load
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing sound asset system
- Uses modern web technologies (SVG data URLs) for compatibility
