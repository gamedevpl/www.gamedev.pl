# MasterPlan Project Analysis

## Overview
MasterPlan is a 2D strategy offline multiplayer game developed as an entry for js13k 2018 by gtanczyk. The game is inspired by Legion Gold (2002) and focuses on creating battle plans and executing them in a turn-based combat system.

## Project Structure
The project follows a typical web application structure:

```

├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.html

│   │       ├── state-game-designer.js
│   │       └── state-game-battle.js
│   └── assets/
```

## Purpose
The game allows players to:
1. Create a master plan for their army
2. Play a battle against an AI or another player's plan
3. Share their plan with other players for competition

## Technologies Used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript (ES6+)
4. Gulp (for build process)
5. Local Storage (for saving game state)

## Key Components

### 1. Game Designer (state-game-designer.js)
- Allows players to create and modify their battle plans
- Handles unit placement, formation, and command assignment
- Provides options to save, load, and share battle plans

### 2. Game Battle (state-game-battle.js)
- Executes the battle based on the created plans
- Manages game world updates, collisions, and battle progression
- Renders the battle and HUD

### 3. MasterPlan (masterplan.js)
- Represents the core logic for battle plans
- Manages unit types, formations, and commands

### 4. Game World (game-world.js)
- Handles the game physics, object interactions, and world state
- Manages collisions between units and projectiles

## Strengths
1. Modular code structure with separate concerns (states, game logic, rendering)
2. Offline multiplayer functionality
3. Compact codebase suitable for js13k competition
4. Use of modern JavaScript features

## Areas for Improvement

1. Code Organization:
   - Consider using a module bundler (e.g., Webpack) for better code organization and dependency management
   - Implement a more robust state management system

2. Performance Optimization:
   - Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects (e.g., arrows, explosions)
   - Use requestAnimationFrame more efficiently in the main game loop

3. Accessibility:
   - Add keyboard controls for better accessibility
   - Improve color contrast for better visibility

4. Responsiveness:
   - Implement a responsive design for better mobile device support

5. AI Improvements:
   - Develop more sophisticated AI strategies for single-player mode

6. Testing:
   - Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure game stability

7. Documentation:
   - Add inline documentation for complex functions
   - Create a comprehensive API documentation

8. User Experience:
   - Implement a tutorial system for new players
   - Add more visual feedback for user actions

9. Scalability:
   - Consider implementing a backend service for online multiplayer functionality
   - Add a leaderboard system to encourage competition

10. Asset Management:
    - Implement a sprite sheet system for more efficient asset loading and rendering

By addressing these areas, the MasterPlan project could be enhanced in terms of code quality, performance, and user experience, while maintaining its core gameplay and offline multiplayer features.
