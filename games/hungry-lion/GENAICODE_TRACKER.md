# GENAICODE TRACKER

This is a list of tasks that were done or are planned for the project.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup

- [x] Initial project setup
- [x] Genaicode configuration and fine tuning

### Core Game Mechanics

- [x] Lion Movement System Implementation
  - Basic movement mechanics with step-based movement
  - Mouse/touch input handling
  - Target position tracking
  - Simple visual representation
  - Viewport tracking
- [x] Lion Targeting System
  - SET_LION_TARGET event handling in GameController
  - Game state updates with target position
  - Integration with input system
  - Mouse/touch target position support
- [x] Single-Step Movement Implementation
  - Single-step movement on click/tap
  - Continuous movement when input is held
  - Proper event handling for both mouse and touch inputs
  - Clear distinction between single-step and continuous movement modes
- [x] Ground Rendering Implementation
  - Simple canvas pattern for ground texture
  - Low performance impact
  - Modular ground rendering system
  - Fixed viewport translation issue
- [x] Prey Entities Implementation
  - Defined prey type and properties
  - Initialized prey entities in the game world
  - Implemented basic AI for prey movement
  - Added spawning mechanic for prey
  - Integrated prey rendering into the game
- [x] Enhanced Prey Behavior
  - Prey now flee when they see the lion moving towards them
  - Prey can see the lion if they are looking towards it, it is within a certain distance, and it is actually moving
- [x] Improved Prey Rendering
  - Prey are now rendered as rotated rectangles
  - Better visual feedback for different states (idle, moving, fleeing)
- [x] Enhanced Prey Fleeing Behavior
  - Implemented sustained fleeing state with duration tracking
  - Added safe distance requirement for returning to idle
  - Improved lion detection with better vision cone mechanics
  - Added random variations to fleeing direction
  - Enhanced visual feedback with dynamic colors and animations
  - Improved prey movement patterns during fleeing
  - Added pulsing effect and visual indicators for fleeing state
- [x] Debug Rendering for Fleeing State
  - Added debug rendering to visualize remaining fleeing time and safe distance condition
  - Enabled debug rendering only in dev mode
