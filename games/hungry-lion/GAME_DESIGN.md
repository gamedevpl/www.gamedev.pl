# ü¶Å Hungry Lion: Survival in the Savanna

## Game Overview

"Hungry Lion" is a 2D top-down survival sandbox game where players take on the role of a lion surviving in the African savanna. The game focuses on realistic hunting mechanics, territory management, and survival against both natural elements and other predators.

## Core Game Loop

1. Hunt when hungry
2. Eat and restore energy
3. Find safe places to rest
4. Defend territory
5. Repeat while avoiding threats

## Game Systems

### 1. Lion State System

#### Physical Appearance
- **Hunger State** (Visually represented)
  - Thin: Starving, urgent need to hunt
  - Normal: Healthy state
  - Thick: Well-fed, good time to rest

#### Energy System
- **Fatigue Visualization**
  - Normal: Steady movement
  - Tired: Visible swaying
  - Exhausted: Severely limited movement capabilities

#### Stats
- Health
- Hunger Level
- Energy Level
- Territory Influence

### 2. Hunting Mechanics

#### Prey Types

1. **Small & Fast Prey**
   - Quick, agile movements
   - Requires precise timing
   - Lower risk, lower reward
   - Example: Gazelles, Rabbits

2. **Medium & Grouped Prey**
   - Travel in herds
   - Require tactical approach
   - Medium risk, medium reward
   - Example: Zebras, Antelope

3. **Large & Dangerous Prey**
   - Powerful opponents
   - High risk, high reward
   - Requires full energy and careful planning
   - Example: Buffalo, Giraffes

#### Hunting Tactics
- Stealth approach
- Sprint attacks
- Ambush opportunities
- Group separation strategies

### 3. Environment System

#### Time Cycle
- **Day/Night System**
  - Dynamic lighting
  - Different prey patterns
  - Variable predator activity
  - Temperature effects

#### Terrain Types
- Tall grass (stealth opportunities)
- Open savanna (high visibility)
- Water holes (gathering points)
- Rocky outcrops (resting spots)
- Forest patches (cover)

#### Weather Effects
- Heat (affects stamina)
- Rain (affects visibility)
- Wind (affects scent detection)

### 4. Territory System

#### Territory Features
- Safe zones for resting
- Hunting grounds
- Water sources
- Strategic vantage points

#### Territory Management
- Mark territory boundaries
- Defend against rival lions
- Maintain presence in valuable areas

### 5. Threat System

#### Predator Types
1. **Rival Lions**
   - Territory disputes
   - Resource competition
   - Social dynamics

2. **Other Predators**
   - Hyenas (group threats)
   - Leopards (solitary competition)
   - Opportunistic threats

3. **Human Threats**
   - Hunters
   - Settlements
   - Vehicles

### 6. User Interface

#### Visual Indicators
- Subtle body changes for hunger
- Movement changes for energy
- Environmental cues
- Threat indicators

#### Controls
- Touch/click movement
- Speed control through input frequency
- Context-sensitive actions
- Attack/rest commands

## Game Progression

### Survival Goals
- Maintain territory
- Build hunting efficiency

## Sound Design

### Sound Categories
1. **Ambient Sounds**
   - Day/night cycle ambience
   - Weather effects
   - Territory-specific sounds

2. **Character Sounds**
   - Movement sounds
   - Combat sounds
   - State indicators

3. **Interaction Sounds**
