# INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENAICODE

This file contains instructions for Genaicode on how to work with this project source code.

## The first and most important instruction

Feel free to update these instructions if you think it can help to continue the project.

## Implementation strategy

### Keep files small and focused

Large and long files are not desired, they make life of programmer harder. LLMs also do not prefer large files with many responsibilities.

### Demand well defined tasks

Feel free to ask me questions, and expect better defined tasks.

### Track your work and plans

Maintain a file called `GENAICODE_TRACKER.md`, use it to store history of changes, and a backlog of tasks for future.
