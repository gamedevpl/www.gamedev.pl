# Game World Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for refactoring the game world implementation using functional programming principles to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Goals
- ⚡ Improve code organization through functional composition
- 🔄 Implement pure function-based state management
- 🎯 Decouple game logic using function composition
- 📈 Enhance performance through immutable state updates
- 🔌 Make the system more extensible using functional patterns

## Phase 1: Core Functional Architecture Setup ⚙️

### State Management
```typescript
type GameState = Readonly<{
  time: number;
  entities: ReadonlyArray<Entity>;
  events: ReadonlyArray<GameEvent>;
}>;

type StateUpdate = (state: GameState) => GameState;
```

### Pure Functions for Core Game Logic
```typescript
// Example of pure function signatures
type UpdateEntity = (entity: Entity, state: GameState) => Entity;
type HandleEvent = (event: GameEvent, state: GameState) => GameState;
type ApplyBehavior = (entity: Entity, behavior: Behavior) => Entity;
```

## Phase 2: Entity Management 🎮

### Lion State Management
- Pure functions for movement updates
- Immutable state transitions for hunger system
- Functional approach to chase mechanics
```typescript
type UpdateLion = (lion: LionState, gameState: GameState) => LionState;
type UpdateHunger = (hunger: HungerState, deltaTime: number) => HungerState;
type UpdateChase = (lion: LionState, prey: PreyState) => LionState;
```

### Prey State Management
- Pure functions for movement patterns
- Functional implementation of fleeing behavior
- Immutable state updates for health system
```typescript
type UpdatePrey = (prey: PreyState, gameState: GameState) => PreyState;
type UpdateFleeing = (prey: PreyState, threats: ReadonlyArray<Threat>) => PreyState;
type UpdateHealth = (health: HealthState, damage: number) => HealthState;
```

## Phase 3: Systems Implementation 🔧

### Pure Function Systems
```typescript
// Core system functions
type MovementSystem = (state: GameState) => GameState;
type CollisionSystem = (state: GameState) => GameState;
type BehaviorSystem = (state: GameState) => GameState;

// Composition of systems
const updateGameState = compose(
  movementSystem,
  collisionSystem,
  behaviorSystem
);
```

## Phase 4: Event System Implementation 📢

### Functional Event Handling
```typescript
type EventHandler = (state: GameState, event: GameEvent) => GameState;
type EventDispatcher = (handlers: ReadonlyArray<EventHandler>) => (state: GameState) => GameState;

// Example events
type CollisionEvent = Readonly<{
  type: 'collision';
  entities: [Entity, Entity];
}>;
```

## Phase 5: Game Loop Optimization 🚀

### Pure Update Functions
```typescript
// Main game loop as composition of pure functions
const gameLoop = compose(
  handleEvents,
  updateEntities,
  applyPhysics,
  cleanupState
);
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Functional Programming Principles
- Use pure functions for all game logic
- Maintain immutable state throughout the system
- Compose functions for complex behavior
- Avoid side effects in core game logic
- Use readonly types for state management

### Code Organization
- Group related functions by domain
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use function composition for complex operations
- Maintain clear data flow between functions

### State Management
- Use immutable state updates
- Implement pure state transition functions
- Compose state updates for complex changes
- Keep state transformations predictable

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Pure function implementation
- ✅ Immutable state management
- ✅ Functional composition
- ✅ Clear data flow
- ✅ Predictable state updates
