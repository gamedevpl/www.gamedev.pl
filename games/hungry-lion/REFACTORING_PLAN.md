# Game World Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for refactoring the game world implementation to improve code organization, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Goals
- ⚡ Improve code organization and maintainability
- 🔄 Implement clear state management
- 🎯 Decouple game logic
- 📈 Enhance performance
- 🧪 Improve testability
- 🔌 Make the system more extensible

## Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup ⚙️
- [ ] Create core directory structure
- [ ] Implement base interfaces and classes
  - [ ] Entity interface and base implementation
  - [ ] Component base class
  - [ ] StateMachine interface
  - [ ] Event system
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework
- [ ] Document core architecture

### Core Components Details
```typescript
// Key interfaces to implement
interface Entity {
  id: string;
  components: Map<string, Component>;
}

interface Component {
  type: string;
  entity: Entity;
}

interface StateMachine<T> {
  currentState: State<T>;
  transition(newState: State<T>): void;
}

interface EventSystem {
  dispatch(event: GameEvent): void;
  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): void;
}
```

## Phase 2: Entity Refactoring 🎮

### Lion Entity
- [ ] Create Lion-specific components
  - [ ] Movement component
  - [ ] Hunger component
  - [ ] Chase component
- [ ] Implement Lion states
  - [ ] Idle state
  - [ ] Hunting state
  - [ ] Eating state
- [ ] Update Lion behavior system

### Prey Entity
- [ ] Create Prey-specific components
  - [ ] Movement component
  - [ ] Fleeing component
  - [ ] Health component
- [ ] Implement Prey states
  - [ ] Idle state
  - [ ] Moving state
  - [ ] Fleeing state
  - [ ] Carrion state
- [ ] Update Prey behavior system

## Phase 3: Systems Implementation 🔧
- [ ] Create systems directory structure
- [ ] Implement core systems
  - [ ] Movement system
  - [ ] Collision system
  - [ ] AI system
  - [ ] Hunger system
- [ ] Update game loop
- [ ] Implement system manager

### Systems Details
```typescript
// Example system interface
interface System {
  update(entities: Entity[], deltaTime: number): void;
}
```

## Phase 4: Event System Implementation 📢
- [ ] Define core game events
  - [ ] Entity collision events
  - [ ] State change events
  - [ ] Game state events
- [ ] Implement event dispatcher
- [ ] Create event handlers
- [ ] Update entities to use events

### Event Types
```typescript
type GameEvent = {
  type: string;
  payload: any;
}

// Example events
type CollisionEvent = {
  type: 'collision';
  payload: {
    entity1: Entity;
    entity2: Entity;
  };
}
```

## Phase 5: Testing and Optimization 🚀
- [ ] Write unit tests
  - [ ] Core components
  - [ ] Entity behavior
  - [ ] Systems
  - [ ] Event handling
- [ ] Performance testing
  - [ ] Measure baseline performance
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks
  - [ ] Optimize critical paths
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Documentation updates

## Phase 6: Migration and Cleanup 🧹
- [ ] Migrate existing game logic
- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Final testing and validation

## Progress Tracking

## Dependencies
- Entity system must be completed before entity refactoring
- Basic event system needed for state machine implementation
- Systems implementation requires completed entity refactoring
- Testing framework needed before implementation phases

## Risk Management
- 🔍 Maintain game functionality during refactoring
- 🔄 Regular testing to catch issues early
- 📦 Incremental changes to minimize disruption
- 📝 Keep documentation updated with changes

## Timeline
1. Phase 1: Core Architecture (1-2 days)
2. Phase 2: Entity Refactoring (2-3 days)
3. Phase 3: Systems Implementation (2-3 days)
4. Phase 4: Event System (1-2 days)
5. Phase 5: Testing and Optimization (2-3 days)
6. Phase 6: Migration and Cleanup (1-2 days)
