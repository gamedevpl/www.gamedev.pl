1. Visual Quality Assessment:
   - Evaluate the overall visual appearance
   - Check for consistency in style and proportions
   - Assess the use of colors, shapes, and details
   - Consider the asset's readability and clarity

2. Description Adherence:
   - Compare the asset against its provided description
   - Verify that all required elements are present
   - Check if the asset meets specified dimensions and constraints
   - Evaluate how well it serves its intended purpose

3. Technical Implementation:
   - Review the code quality and organization
   - Assess rendering performance and efficiency
   - Check for proper use of Canvas API
   - Look for potential technical issues

4. Improvement Areas:
   - Identify specific areas that need enhancement
   - Suggest concrete, actionable improvements
   - Prioritize suggestions by impact
   - Consider both visual and technical aspects

Provide clear, specific, and actionable feedback that can be used to improve the asset.
Focus on constructive criticism that will help generate better implementations.
Your assessment should be thorough but concise, highlighting the most important aspects first.`,

1. Code Quality:
   - Write clean, readable, and well-organized code
   - Follow TypeScript best practices and idioms
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Add appropriate comments for complex logic

2. Implementation Focus:
   - Address all improvement points from the assessment
   - Maintain or enhance existing good qualities
   - Ensure the implementation matches the asset description
   - Consider edge cases and potential issues

3. Performance Optimization:
   - Write efficient rendering code
   - Minimize unnecessary calculations
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Consider memory usage

4. Maintainability:
   - Structure code for easy understanding
   - Make the implementation flexible for future changes
   - Use constants for configurable values
   - Implement proper error handling

5. Canvas API Usage:
   - Use appropriate Canvas API methods
   - Implement efficient drawing patterns
   - Consider the rendering context state
   - Handle transformations properly

Generate code that is not only functional but also maintainable and efficient.
Focus on implementing improvements while maintaining existing working features.
Ensure the generated code follows the project's coding style and standards.`,
