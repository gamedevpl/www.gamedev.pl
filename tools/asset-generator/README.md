# Assets Generator

Assets generator tool can create assets for games:

- characters, animations
- visual effects

Asset is a code that is responsible for rendering the asset.

## How it works

1. Define the asset, describe it in detail
2. Execute generator
3. Generator creates asset
4. Asset is rendered
5. Generator analyses the asset rendering outcome
6. Go back to point 3 (or stop iteration)
7. Asset code is created
