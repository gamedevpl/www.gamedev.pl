We are adding more bonuses to the game:

- Tsunami: water will flood the grid, will start slowing down movements of player and monsters, and at 13th step it will elimiante everyone. The only way to survive is to climb on top of an obstacle (Climber bonus)
- Monster: Player becomes a monster, and monsters become the player for the next 13 steps. Player-monster can eliminate monsters-players. If all monster-players are eliminated it is a game over. Monster-player can also reach the goal, and it means level complete.
- Slide: The player movement is always a slide either to the edge of grid or to the obstacle
- Sokoban: Player can move obstacles like in Sokoban game. It also allows to crush monsters
- Blaster: Player receives a blaster to their hand, and whenever they move, the blaster shots in that direction. Blaster shot can eliminate the first monster which is in the line of sight

This task is about:

- updating game logic
- updating rendering to accomodate the new bonuses
- updating instructions
- updating design doc

At this point please do not modify level generation.
