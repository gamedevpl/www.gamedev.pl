I'm participating in js13k 2024 competition. The theme this year is "triskaidekaphobia", so I want to build a game for this topic. You need to help me with his. The game we want to build must use javascript, will run in web wbrowser, and should be very lightweight (13 kilobytes compressed), so probably we want to build something simple with small sized assets.

I want you to go through all ideas defined in the idea/ folder and select the one which is the best for this theme. Please consider the following points:
- feels like something fun to play
- feasibility of implementation
- there is some novelity in the idea
- is not too big (for example: there is no need to have many graphical assets)
- ideally if the idea can be implemented with simple vector graphics

Please analyze the description and the images.

Once the idea is selected please create a new directory(game/) for the selected game idea, and in that directory create following files:
- design doc for game play (exhaustive description)
- design doc for game ui (as much details as possible)
- design doc for game states
- technical design of how the game should be implemented (implementation details are essential)

those files could be put into game/design/ subfolder

see placeholder implementation in game/src/, there is a index.html, and main.ts, so the technical design should use it as a fundament
