I'm participating in js13k 2024 competition. The theme this year is "triskaidekaphobia", so I want to build a game for this topic. You need to help me with his. The game we want to build must use javascript, will run in web wbrowser, and should be very lightweight (13 kilobytes compressed), so probably we want to build something simple with small sized assets.

I want you to create a ideas/ folder, and generate 13 ideas for this theme.
Each idea should be a .md file with description.

I'm looking for ideas for games with 2d graphics, that will be easy to implement with html5 canvas. The games should be simple and fun. General requirement is that the game should have specific states:
- intro splash screen, with instructions on how to play the game
- the actual gameplay state
- pause state
- game over with results, and an option to play again

Please propose diverse range of genres.
