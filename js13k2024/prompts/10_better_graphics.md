I want the game to look like it was designed on the "gameplay_state.png" image, so I think the following must change:

- the game view must be isometric
- under the grid there must be something like a platform
- the colors should be similar as on the aforementioned image
- I want objects like the obstacles, player, monsters, and bonuses to be rendered as pseudo 3d
- I want overall nicer graphics of all game screens
