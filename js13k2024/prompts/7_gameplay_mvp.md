The game starts to look similar to what we have described in the designs.

Please fix the following problems in gameplay if they still exist:
- obstacles are not rendered
- game should start without 0 monsters initially
- a monster should be spawned every 13th step of the player
- a monster should move towards the player, but also avoid the obstacles
- instruction should also tell the user to not get caught by monster
- steps counter should reset every 13th step 
- monster cannot step on each other
- monsters should have some basic pathfinding algorithm
- size of the grid and number of obstacles should increase with level (difficulty)
- monsters should not be spawned immediately next to player
- initial level should not put obstacle on player starting position
- ensure there is always a path from start to finish
