I want to have sounds in the game. The sounds should be synthesized as due to 13kb limit we cannot use any assets.

Following situations should trigger sounds:

- player making a step
- electrical discharge
- bonus is collected
- explosion
- transition between states of the game
- game over
- level completed
- monster is spawned
