I'm participating in js13k 2024 competition. The theme this year is "triskaidekaphobia", so I want to build a game for this topic. You need to help me with his. The game we want to build must use javascript, will run in web wbrowser, and should be very lightweight (13 kilobytes compressed), so probably we want to build something simple with small sized assets.

I want you to go through all 13 ideas that are defined in the idea/ folder and generate images that will tell me how such game would look like. The images should show a sketch of the gameplay that is defined in the corresponding .md file. I recommend providing an exhaustive prompt to the image generation request.
Put the image file next to description file.
